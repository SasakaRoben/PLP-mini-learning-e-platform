# PLP-mini-learning-e-platform
# Project Brief:
Create a mini e-learning platform that allows learners to:

1. View a list of courses (at least 3).
2. See course details when clicked.
3. Mark a course as “completed”.
4. Optionally, include user login or sign-up functionality.

The focus is on building a functional prototype, not a full production-ready system.
